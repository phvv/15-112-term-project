Term Project User Study Feedback

The last class before the project was due, we held a mini user study. I got great feedback on my project.
Unfortunately, I do not have the time to implement the suggestions that I received. The main suggestion was to
turn all of the places you press to move through the application into buttons. Currently they are just drawn 
rectangles and circles, but buttons would allow the user to hopefully more clearly navigate their way through
the application. Other than that, I was told to increase the font size certain places and to bold other text.
The small changes like those, I did do. The last change I made from the user study was to make all of the
'buttons' on my home screen have a fill of white so they clearly stood out from the background.
